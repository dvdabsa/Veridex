/**
 * SIMULATED FUNCTION: Redirects to Stripe Checkout.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This function simulates the frontend part of a real Stripe integration.
 * It does NOT include a real backend and does NOT process real payments.
 * 
 * The secure, real-world flow is as follows:
 * 1. This function sends the `priceId` to your backend server (e.g., at `POST ${BACKEND_URL}/create-checkout-session`).
 * 2. Your backend server (which you must build separately) uses your STRIPE SECRET KEY to create a
 *    Stripe Checkout Session and returns the `sessionId`.
 * 3. The frontend receives the `sessionId`.
 * 4. The frontend then uses the official Stripe.js library to redirect the user to Stripe's hosted checkout page.
 *    `const stripe = await loadStripe(STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);`
 *    `await stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId: 'session_id_from_backend' });`
 *
 * For this demo, we will simulate this process by simply redirecting to a success page.
